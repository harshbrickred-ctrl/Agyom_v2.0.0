/**
 * Requirement Intake — lifecycle verification checklist (API)
 *
 * Run against a live local stack after `pnpm db:seed`:
 *
 * 1. Login as a SALES user (create via Admin after seeding with SEED_ADMIN_*).
 * 2. POST /api/v1/requirements with core fields only → expect ACTIVE,
 *    openPositions = numberOfPositions, closedPositions = 0,
 *    closureStatus = ON_TRACK, taHandoffSlaRag from requirement age.
 * 3. PUT /api/v1/requirements/:id (Sales owner) → full-body edit of intake fields;
 *    PATCH remains for partial updates (TA limited fields).
 *    Sales cannot edit another owner's requirement (403).
 * 4. PATCH handoff + TA owner → taReadyReqId set, SLA freezes at handoff age.
 * 4. As TA: POST /candidates on ACTIVE req → 201; on CANCELLED/CLOSED → 400.
 * 5. Select candidate → create offer → ACCEPTED → create onboarding → JOINED.
 * 6. Confirm requirement open/closed recount; when JOINED count ≥ numberOfPositions
 *    → status CLOSED, closureStatus FILLED; dashboard summary open/closed/fillRate update.
 *    Until then (partial JOINED), requirement stays ACTIVE and more candidates can be added.
 * 7. Revert JOINED → requirement reopens to ACTIVE when joined < numberOfPositions.
 * 8. GET /requirements/REQ-00001 resolves by publicId.
